Research Methodology
-------------------

Our project involves intensive data cleaning to process and organize our demographic data, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns. We utilize Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization to ensure clear presentations of the demographic trends observed.
